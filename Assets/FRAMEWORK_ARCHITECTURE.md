# Modular Mini-Game Framework Architecture

## Overview
This Unity project implements a modular, extensible mini-game framework following SOLID principles and clean architecture patterns. The framework supports easy addition of new mini-games through a well-structured base system.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. **Modular Design**
- Each mini-game is self-contained with its own scripts and assets
- Shared functionality is abstracted into the Framework layer
- Easy to add new games by extending base classes

### 2. **SOLID Principles**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Framework is open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: All mini-games implement the same interface
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### 3. **Clean Architecture**
- **Framework Layer**: Core systems (Events, Scene Management, UI)
- **Game Layer**: Mini-game implementations
- **Utilities Layer**: Helper classes and extensions

### 4. **Event-Driven Communication**
- Decoupled modules communicate through events
- No direct dependencies between mini-games
- Framework systems broadcast state changes

## Key Framework Components

### 🎮 **Mini-Game Base System**
- `IMiniGame` interface for all games
- `MiniGameBase` abstract class with common functionality
- `MiniGameManager` for game lifecycle management

### 🎬 **Scene Management**
- Smooth loading/unloading of mini-game scenes
- Loading screens and transitions
- Memory management for scene assets

### 🎨 **UI System**
- Modular UI panels with shared components
- Transition animations between games
- Responsive design patterns

### 💾 **Save/Load System**
- Player progress persistence
- Game-specific save data
- Settings and preferences management

### 🔊 **Audio System**
- Background music management
- Sound effect pooling
- Audio settings and mixing

### ⚡ **Event System**
- Global event bus for framework communication
- Type-safe event publishing/subscribing
- Automatic cleanup and memory management

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Framework
1. Event system implementation
2. Scene management system
3. Base mini-game classes and interfaces
4. Save/Load system foundation

### Phase 2: UI Framework
1. Modular UI panel system
2. Transition animations
3. Main menu implementation
4. Common UI components

### Phase 3: Mini-Game Implementations
1. Match-3 puzzle game
2. Endless runner game
3. Game-specific UI integration
4. Polish and gameplay refinement

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish
1. Audio system integration
2. Save/Load implementation for both games
3. Performance optimization
4. Documentation and code cleanup

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Scalability**: Easy to add new mini-games
2. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
3. **Testability**: Modular components can be tested independently
4. **Reusability**: Framework components can be reused across projects
5. **Flexibility**: Easy to modify or extend existing functionality

## Next Steps

With this folder structure in place, we can begin implementing:
1. Core framework interfaces and base classes
2. Event system for decoupled communication
3. Scene management for smooth transitions
4. UI framework for modular interfaces
5. First mini-game implementation (Match-3)

This architecture provides a solid foundation for a professional, extensible mini-game framework that follows industry best practices.
